<h1>Appendix B: Pod Racing Dataset</h1>

<p>We‚Äôve been using a made-up Pod Racing dataset in multiple examples, as we
discussed fine-tuning, memory, recall, and how we can make new data available to
a large language model. Models are trained on data available publicly on the
internet, and we had to make sure we‚Äôre using some data the model never saw
before for our examples.</p>

<p>Of course, since this book is on the internet and the code is on GitHub, a newer
generation model might get trained on it, making the dataset less useful. That
said, it works fine for the models we‚Äôve been dealing with.</p>

<p>The full dataset is the book GitHub‚Äôs repository,
<a href="https://github.com/vladris/llm-book/">https://github.com/vladris/llm-book/</a>, under the <code>/code/racing</code> folder.</p>

<p>Here it is, for completeness:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>During the Tatooine Grand Prix Pod Racing race, there were several thrilling and
unexpected moments that led to the final standings:

Thunderous Takeoff: At the starting line, Senn Kava&#39;s Thunderbolt pod launched
with an extraordinary burst of speed, leaving the other racers in awe. The
expertly tuned engine of the Thunderbolt provided an unprecedented acceleration
advantage, allowing Kava to establish a commanding lead right from the
beginning.

Shadow Racer&#39;s Slipstream: As the race progressed, Vix Tor&#39;s Shadow Racer
skillfully utilized the aerodynamic properties of the pod to ride the slipstream
created by the Thunderbolt. By closely tailing behind Kava, Tor minimized air
resistance and gained a significant speed boost, catapulting the Shadow Racer
into the top three positions.

Thrilling Aerial Maneuvers: Remy Thal, piloting the Crimson Fang, exhibited
exceptional piloting skills during a treacherous section of the racecourse. Thal
expertly navigated through a series of tight turns and dangerous obstacles,
executing daring mid-air flips and barrel rolls. The crowd held their breath as
the Crimson Fang narrowly avoided collisions, ultimately propelling Thal into
second place.

Lightning Bolt&#39;s Electrifying Boost: Tira Suro&#39;s Lightning Bolt had a unique
energy-harvesting system integrated into its design. During the race, Suro
strategically positioned the pod near an electrical storm that unexpectedly
formed on the course. The Lightning Bolt harnessed the electrical energy,
momentarily activating a boost of unparalleled speed. However, the power surge
was short-lived, and Suro slipped to fourth place after the energy dissipated.

Razor Blade&#39;s Perilous Gamble: Kael Voss, piloting the Razor Blade, took a
daring risk to gain an advantage during the race. In a section with a hazardous
sandstorm, Voss decided to take an alternate route through a rocky canyon. While
this path appeared shorter, it was fraught with perilous terrain and
unpredictable gusts of wind. Despite the danger, Voss showcased remarkable
precision and nerve, allowing the Razor Blade to secure the fifth-place
position.

These exhilarating moments and unexpected tactics turned the Tatooine Grand Prix
Pod Racing race into a thrilling spectacle for spectators, leaving them on the
edge of their seats until the checkered flag was waved.

an impeccable start, propelling the pod forward with flawless precision as the
race began. Tor&#39;s lightning-fast reflexes and exceptional control allowed the
Shadow Racer to surge ahead, securing an early lead that would prove challenging
for the other racers to overcome.

Thunderbolt&#39;s Electrifying Overtake: Senn Kava, piloting the Thunderbolt pod,
demonstrated remarkable strategic prowess by analyzing the track layout and
identifying a section with a narrow gap between two buildings. With
lightning-fast reflexes, Kava skillfully maneuvered the Thunderbolt through the
tight space, executing a daring overtaking maneuver that caught the other racers
off guard. This audacious move propelled Kava into second place.

Lightning Bolt&#39;s Power Surge: Tira Suro, piloting the Lightning Bolt, possessed
a unique modification that allowed the pod to temporarily tap into the city&#39;s
power grid. In a thrilling moment, Suro synchronized the pod&#39;s energy absorption
mechanism with a nearby power junction, causing a momentary power surge. This
sudden burst of speed propelled the Lightning Bolt past Kael Voss&#39;s Razor Blade,
securing the third-place position for Suro.

Razor Blade&#39;s Risky Shortcut: Kael Voss, the pilot of the Razor Blade, spotted
an uncharted shortcut that promised to shave precious seconds off the lap time.
Without hesitation, Voss veered off the traditional track, navigating through a
perilous maze of lower city alleys and weaving through oncoming traffic.
Although this daring shortcut briefly propelled the Razor Blade into a higher
position, Voss&#39;s progress was hindered by an unexpected construction site. Voss
narrowly avoided a collision, but the delay allowed Remy Thal&#39;s Crimson Fang to
reclaim the fourth-place position.

Crimson Fang&#39;s Mechanical Glitch: Remy Thal, piloting the Crimson Fang,
encountered a sudden mechanical glitch during a crucial stretch of the race. A
vital thruster malfunctioned, causing the pod&#39;s acceleration to decrease
significantly. Thal battled valiantly to regain lost ground but was unable to
recover fully, ultimately finishing in fifth place.
