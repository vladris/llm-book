<h1>Prompt Engineering</h1>

<p><img src="images/03/cover.png" alt="Prompt Engineering"></p>

<p>In this chapter:</p>

<ul>
<li>Designing powerful prompts.</li>
<li>Using templates for prompts.</li>
<li>Selecting between multiple templates.</li>
<li>Chaining prompts to perform complex tasks.</li>
</ul>

<p>This chapter is all about prompts, the fundamental way we interact with large
language models. Prompts are key components of any solution built around these
models, so we need to have a solid understanding of how to leverage them to the
maximum.</p>

<p>We‚Äôll start with <em>prompt design</em> and <em>tuning</em> and see how small tweaks to the
prompt can elicit very different responses from a large language model. We‚Äôll
iterate over a simple example and look at some tips on what we should include in
a prompt.</p>

<p>If we‚Äôll spend so much time coming up with the perfect prompt, we‚Äôll probably
want to reuse it. We‚Äôll see how we can do this via <em>prompt templating</em>. We‚Äôll
implement a generic function that will enable us to specify prompt templates as
JSON files, then load these to fill in the prompts we send to the model.</p>

<p>In many scenarios, we have multiple prompt templates we can use, and we need to
solve the problem of which one to pick based on what the user wants. Luckily,
understanding user intent is something large language models are great at. We‚Äôll
implement <em>prompt selection</em> and automate picking the right prompt.</p>

<p>Most non-trivial tasks can‚Äôt be accomplished through a single prompt ‚Äì we‚Äôll
have to divide and conquer. We can complete complex tasks with multiple
(connected) prompts, something known as <em>prompt chaining</em>. We‚Äôll cover the
arguably simplest type of chaining ‚Äì maintaining a chat history, then we‚Äôll look
at a more complex scenario involving a multi-step workflow. Let‚Äôs start with the
basics though: design.</p>

<h2 id="prompt-design-&amp;-tuning">Prompt design &amp; tuning</h2>

<p>In chapter 1 we briefly touched on the emerging discipline of <em>prompt
engineering</em> and defined it as the process of creating and optimizing natural
language prompts for large language models. Let‚Äôs see why prompts are such a key
piece of integrating these models into software solutions.</p>

<p>We‚Äôll start with a simple scenario: we have some content we‚Äôd like summarized.
You can use <a href="https://chat.openai.com/">https://chat.openai.com/</a> for the examples in this section, or the
OpenAI playground (<a href="https://platform.openai.com/playground/">https://platform.openai.com/playground/</a>). Listing 3.1 shows
the content ‚Äì a business plan for a new minimalist phone.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Our company aims to disrupt the smartphone market by introducing a minimalist
phone that focuses on the essentials. We believe that in a world where
technology is becoming increasingly complex, there is a growing demand for a
device that simplifies our lives and allows us to be more present in the moment.

Our minimalist phone will have a simple and sleek design, with a monochrome
display and limited features. It will focus on the core functionalities of a
phone, such as calling, texting, and taking photos, while eliminating
unnecessary distractions and time-wasting apps. By doing so, our phone will
promote mindfulness and productivity, while also reducing screen time and
digital overload.

In terms of pricing, we plan to position our minimalist phone as a premium
product that is worth the investment. We believe that our target audience, which
consists of busy professionals, digital minimalists, and people who value
simplicity and mindfulness, will be willing to pay a premium for a device that
aligns with their values and lifestyle.

To market our minimalist phone, we will leverage social media and influencer
marketing, as well as targeted advertising campaigns. We will also partner with
like-minded brands and organizations that share our vision of simplifying and
improving people&#39;s lives. Finally, we will prioritize customer satisfaction and
offer exceptional customer service and support, as well as regular updates and
improvements to the phone&#39;s software and functionality.

Overall, we are confident that our minimalist phone will revolutionize the
smartphone industry and offer a refreshing alternative to the current state of
technology. We look forward to launching our product and making a positive
impact on people&#39;s lives.
</pre></div>

<p><em>Listing 3.1: A business plan for a minimalist phone (AI generated).</em></p>

<p>We‚Äôd like to get this summarized into a few short bullet points, which we can
surface in our UI. We prompt the model with a simple prompt shown in listing 3.2
(business plan omitted).</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Summarize this business plan &quot;&lt;business plan from listing 3.1 goes here&gt;&quot;
</pre></div>

<p><em>Listing 3.2: Prompt to summarize the business plan.</em></p>

<p>We might get back something like listing 3.3 (again, large language models are
non-deterministic so you might get a different response).</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>The business plan outlines a strategy to disrupt the smartphone market by
introducing a minimalist phone that focuses on the essentials, with a simple and
sleek design, limited features, and a monochrome display. The phone will be
positioned as a premium product, targeting busy professionals, digital
minimalists, and people who value simplicity and mindfulness. The company plans
to leverage social media, influencer marketing, and partnerships with
like-minded brands to market the phone. The company will prioritize customer
satisfaction, offer regular updates and improvements, and aims to make a
positive impact on people&#39;s lives.
</pre></div>

<p><em>Listing 3.3: Summary of business plan.</em></p>

<p>This is a good summary, but not quite what we want ‚Äì let‚Äôs explicitly ask for bullet points. Listing 3.4 shows the <em>refined prompt</em>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Summarize this business plan &quot;&lt;business plan from listing 3.1 goes here&gt;&quot; in a
few short bullet points
</pre></div>

<p><em>Listing 3.4: Refined prompt to summarize the business plan.</em></p>

<p>Since we introduced the term, let‚Äôs also define it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: A <em>refined prompt</em> is a prompt revised and optimized through
multiple iterations to elicit the most accurate and desirable responses from a
large language model. This typically involves tuning the language, syntax,
structure, and context of the prompt to make it more specific and effective in
achieving the desired outcome.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Refined prompts are crucial for improving the performance of large language
models across all applications. In our case, the refined prompt gives us the
output in listing 3.5.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>* Company aims to disrupt smartphone market with minimalist phone
* Phone will have simple and sleek design, with limited features
* Focus on core functionalities of calling, texting, and photos
* Target audience consists of busy professionals, digital minimalists, and those
  who value simplicity and mindfulness
* Phone will be positioned as a premium product worth investment
* Marketing will leverage social media, influencer marketing, and targeted
  advertising
* Partnership with like-minded brands and organizations
* Priority on customer satisfaction and support with regular updates and
  improvements
* Goal is to revolutionize smartphone industry and make positive impact on
  people&#39;s lives
</pre></div>

<p><em>Listing 3.5: Summary of business plan.</em></p>

<p>This is closer, but still too many bullet points and too many words ‚Äì our UI can‚Äôt fit all of this. Let‚Äôs try again with listing 3.6.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Summarize this business plan &quot;&lt;business plan from listing 3.1 goes here&gt;&quot; in no
more than 5 bullet points, at most 7 words each
</pre></div>

<p><em>Listing 3.6: More detailed prompt.</em></p>

<p>This gets us the output in listing 3.7.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>* Minimalist phone focusing on essentials
* Promotes mindfulness and productivity
* Premium product for busy professionals
* Leverage social media and partnerships
* Revolutionize smartphone industry with simplicity
</pre></div>

<p><em>Listing 3.7: Summary of business plan.</em></p>

<p>This is close to what we want. This simple example was an exercise in <em>prompt
design</em> and <em>tuning</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: <em>Prompt design</em> is the process of constructing a high-quality
input sequence, or prompt, that will guide the model to generate a desired
output.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The prompt typically consists of a few words, phrases, or sentences that provide
context and direction for the model to generate text that aligns with the user&#39;s
intention. Effective prompt design significantly improves the quality and
relevance of the generated text.</p>

<p>Prompt design involves carefully selecting and arranging the words and phrases
in the prompt to guide the model toward the desired output, while avoiding
ambiguity or confusion.</p>

<p>We are still discovering the best, most effective prompt recipes, but a starting
point for a good prompt includes telling the model:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Who to act like</strong> - This can be ‚Äúyou are an AI assistant‚Äù, or ‚Äúrespond as a
high-school teacher‚Äù, or ‚Äúact like Stephen King‚Äù.</li>
<li><strong>Additional context</strong> ‚Äì We‚Äôll cover this in a lot more depth later on when we
discuss memory in chapter 5. For now, think of this as any additional
information that helps clarify the ask or provides data that can be used when
generating the answer.</li>
<li><strong>Who the audience is</strong> ‚Äì You can tweak the response by being specific about
the audience (e.g., ‚Äúexplain like I‚Äôm 5 years old‚Äù).</li>
<li><strong>How the output should look like</strong> ‚Äì You can be as descriptive as needed.
*‚ÄúShort summary‚Äù, ‚Äú500 word article‚Äù, or ‚Äú5 bullet points no more than 7 words
*each‚Äù.</li>
<li><strong>How to go about generating the output</strong> ‚Äì Additional instructions for the
*large language model, like ‚Äúthink step by step‚Äù.</li>
<li><strong>Examples</strong> ‚Äì It helps to give examples; we‚Äôll talk more about this in the
next chapter. Examples are good way of showing the large language model what
you expect.</li>
<li><strong>Proper syntax</strong> ‚Äì Using the correct capitalization, grammar, and punctuation
*helps (as it should more closely match data the model has been trained on).</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, if we‚Äôre talking about integration within other systems, we care
about the shape of the output. Instead of asking <code>summarize this business plan</code>,
we are specific about how we want the format (<code>5 bullet points, no more than 7
words each</code>).</p>

<p>Of course, for complex scenarios, you won‚Äôt get the prompt right in one go.
You‚Äôll have to refine it several times. This iterative process is called <em>prompt
tuning</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: <em>Prompt tuning</em> refers to the iterative process of refining
and adjusting prompts used with large language models. In prompt tuning, the
goal is to create prompts that are optimized to produce the desired output from
the model.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People are getting more and more interesting outputs out of large language
models by coming up with intricate prompts. These highly tuned prompts are
colloquially called <em>superprompts</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Sidebar: Superprompt example ‚Äì interview practice</strong><sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>An example of one of this type of ‚Äúmagical‚Äù prompt is a prompt that enables
you to practice interviewing with ChatGPT. In the ChatGPT UI, you can start
with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>I want you to act as an interviewer. I will be the candidate and you will ask
me the interview questions for the {{position}} position. I want you to only
reply as the interviewer. Do not write all the conversation at once. I want
you to only do the interview with me. Ask me the questions and wait for my
answers. Do not write explanations. Ask me the questions one by one like an
interviewer does and wait for my answers. My first sentence is &quot;Hi&quot;.
</pre></div>

<p>Replace <code>{{position}}</code> with the actual position you want to practice for, then
you can use ChatGPT to help you prepare!</p>

<p>Note the detailed description of how the model should reply and what it should
not output. This prompt was likely created with a lot of tuning, starting from a
simpler ask then iterating as the model replied in unrealistic ways. For
example, the ‚Äúdo not write all the conversation at once‚Äù probably ended up there
as without it the large language model would imagine a whole interview exchange
and respond with it in one go.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A somewhat magical phrase that seems to help in many prompts is ‚Äúthink step by
step‚Äù or variations of it, like ‚Äúthink about this logically‚Äù. This is called
<em>chain-of-thought</em>, explicitly asking the large language model to list the steps
it takes to arrive at a result rather than just producing the result.</p>

<h3>Chain-of-thought prompts</h3>

<p>For example, for more complex questions that involve multiple steps, the model
might offer a wrong response without additional priming. The prompt in listing
3.8, when run against <code>text-davinci-003</code>, gets the wrong response.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>In a bouquet of 12 flowers, half are roses. Half of the roses are red. How many
red roses are in the bouquet?
</pre></div>

<p><em>Listing 3.8: Multiple-step problem prompt.</em></p>

<p>The response is <code>6 roses</code>, which is wrong. <code>gpt-3.5-turbo</code> seems to answer this
correctly, but you get the point ‚Äì more convoluted questions could elicit a
wrong response. Interestingly enough, if we enhance our prompt with ‚Äúthink step
by step‚Äù as in listing 3.9, the model produces the correct response.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>In a bouquet of 12 flowers, half are roses. Half of the roses are red. How many
red roses are in the bouquet? Think step by step.
</pre></div>

<p><em>Listing 3.9: Chain-of-thought prompt.</em></p>

<p>Now we get a more detailed, step-by-step answer, shown in listing 3.10.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Step 1: Half of 12 flowers is 6. 
Step 2: Half of 6 roses is 3.
Answer: There are 3 red roses in the bouquet.
</pre></div>

<p><em>Listing 3.10: Chain-of-thought prompt response.</em></p>

<p>Turns out the model could generate the correct response all along, but it needed
additional guidance. In some cases, simply adding ‚Äúthink step by step‚Äù or
similar phrases is enough. In other cases, including an example of how this
step-by-step reasoning looks like in the prompt helps. See Listing 3.11 for an
example of this.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Q: In a bouquet of 24 flowers, half are roses. A third of the roses are red. How
many red roses are in the bouquet?

A: The bouquet has 24 flowers, so half of them being roses means there are 12
roses. A third of the roses are red out of 12 rose, so there are 4 red roses in
the bouquet.

Q: In a bouquet of 12 flowers, half are roses. Half of the roses are red. How
may red roses are in the bouquet?

A:
</pre></div>

<p><em>Listing 3.11: Chain-of-thought prompt with examples.</em></p>

<p>When using this prompt with <code>text-davinci-003</code>, the response mimics the example
and arrives at the correct answer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: <em>Chain-of-thought prompting</em> is a technique that can be used
to improve the reasoning and accuracy performance of large language models by
providing rationales for a given word or phrase. It improves the reasoning
ability of large language models by prompting them to generate a series of
intermediate steps that lead to the final answer of a multi-step problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chain-of-though explicitly encourages the large language model to generate
intermediate rationales for solving a problem, either through a phrase like
‚Äúthink step by step‚Äù or by providing a series of reasoning steps in a
demonstration that is part of the prompt.</p>

<p>In general, chain-of-thought prompting can elicit better reasoning from large
language models on logic, math, and symbolic reasoning tasks<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Keep this in
mind ‚Äì sometimes a small phrase added to a prompt can get dramatically better
replies, and providing examples helps. While large language models can
demonstrate surprisingly good reasoning skills, their intelligence is very
different than how our brains work. Prompt engineering aims to bridge the gap
and identify the right way to ask questions to get the best responses.</p>

<p>Nowadays there are many repositories of tried and tested prompts online. We
already saw a superprompt from <a href="https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts">https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts</a>.
Wolfram has a prompt repository at
<a href="https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PromptRepository/">https://resources.wolframcloud.com/PromptRepository/</a>. Many other prompt
repositories are available on GitHub.</p>

<p>As we just saw, coming up with a good prompt is hard work. In fact, from
personal experience, I can say that 80% of lighting up a scenario involving a
large language model is coming up with the right prompt (one of the reasons
<em>prompt engineering</em> is emerging as a new discipline). So, what do we do once we
find the perfect prompt?</p>

<h2 id="prompt-templates">Prompt templates</h2>

<p>Once we do come up with the perfect prompt, we want to store this somewhere and
reuse it. We can parameterize the context (instance-specific information) based
on the scenario while maintaining the common part of the prompt.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs implement a simple templating system: we‚Äôll store the template as a JSON
file. This should contain a prompt. The customizable parts we put around <code>{{}}</code>,
for example <code>{{action}}</code> is customizable and we replace it with some actual
value when we make a call to OpenAI.</p>

<p>We can optionally set other parameters, like we discussed in chapter 2 (e.g.
<code>n</code>, <code>max_tokens</code>, <code>temperature</code>, <code>stop</code>).</p>

<p>Listing 3.12 shows an example of templating a prompt that can help us with some legal work. Let‚Äôs say after careful tuning, we realized we get the best results if we explicitly tell the large language model it is a lawyer, and lower the temperature. We can store this in <code>lawyer.json</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">&quot;temperature&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">0.2</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">&quot;max_tokens&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">&quot;prompt&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;You are a lawyer. {{action}}: {{document}}&quot;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p><em>Listing 3.12: Lawyer prompt template.</em></p>

<p>In this case we customize <code>temperature</code> (lower since we want some help with
legal documents and we don‚Äôt want the model to get too creative) and
<code>max_tokens</code> (since we‚Äôre playing with the API while learning and don‚Äôt want to
pay too much for running code samples). Our prompt tells the model to act as a
lawyer and has two customizable parts: an <code>action</code> and a <code>document</code>.</p>

<p>Figure 3.1 shows how prompt templating works.</p>

<p><img src="images/03/fig1.png" alt="Figure 3.1"></p>

<p>We have a prompt template with some parameters. The prompt template contains our
tuned prompt text, but also includes some customizable parts captured between
<code>{{}}</code>. We take the user input and use that to replace the <code>{{}}</code> parameters and
end up with a prompt we send to the large language model.</p>

<p>We can then implement a Python class that handles templates, as seen in listing
3.13.</p>

<p><em>Listing 3.13: Consuming a completion prompt template.</em></p>

<p>This might look a bit complicated, but it really isn‚Äôt. First, we implement an
<code>insert_params()</code> function, which takes a string and a set of keyword arguments
(see sidebar). It searches for <code>{{}}</code> parameters using a regular expression and
replaces these with the actual values provided as <code>kwargs</code>.</p>

<p>Next, we define a <code>Template</code> class. The constructor takes a template dictionary
and stores it as a class member. We define a static <code>from_file()</code> method which
loads the template JSON from the given <code>template_file</code> and constructs a
<code>Template</code> object based on that. Finally, we define a <code>completion()</code> method that
takes some parameters (in our case, these would be the actual <code>action</code> and
<code>document</code>), makes a deep copy of the prompt template which it updates with the
given parameters, then calls the OpenAI Completion API, and expand the
parameters available in <code>template</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Sidebard: Keyword Arguments in Python</strong></p>

<p>In Python, <code>**kwargs</code> is a special syntax used to pass a keyworded,
variable-length argument list to a function. The <code>**kwargs</code> parameter in a
function allows you to pass an arbitrary number of keyword arguments (as
key/value) to that function.</p>

<p><code>**kwargs</code> can be used along with other parameters in a function definition,
but it should always come after all the other parameters, including any default
parameters.</p>

<p>The <code>openai.Completion.create</code> (and <code>openai.ChatCompletion.create()</code>) expect
named arguments (like <code>n=1</code>, <code>max_tokens=100</code> etc.). Instead of us checking if
each of the supported arguments appears in our JSON files and composing the
function call based on that, we simply forward the dictionary object (key/value
pairs) we deserialized from JSON to the <code>create()</code> function. It will
conveniently pick up the parameters it understands from there ‚Äì for example if
we specify <code>&quot;temperature&quot;: 0.5</code> in our JSON, when we load the JSON file this
gets mapped into the key/value pair <code>&quot;temperature&quot;: 0.5</code>, then resolved as the
function argument <code>temperature=0.5</code>.</p>

<p>This is not a Python book but using this ‚Äútrick‚Äù simplifies our code a lot, so
it‚Äôs worth understanding. You can think of this as forwarding the properties
from the JSON file directly to the function, then the function interprets the
ones it <em>understands</em> and ignores the rest.</p>

<p>We do the same with the <code>parameters</code> when we call <code>insert_params()</code> ‚Äì this
formats the string so the function looks for the keys that appear inside the
string between <code>{{}}</code> and it ignores additional key/value pairs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now we have a template and a function that can take it and turn it into an API
call. The <code>Template</code> class is part of the <code>llm_utils</code> module introduced in
chapter 1 and covered in appendix A.</p>

<p>We‚Äôll be using prompt templates throughout the remainder of the book. We already
saw how to call the OpenAI API directly and some of the customizable parameters.
Instead of repeating the OpenAI API calls, we‚Äôll just show the prompt templates
and parameters.</p>

<p>Since we‚Äôll be using prompt templates throughout the remainder of the book, this
module gives us an easy way to import them when needed in our code samples.
Listing 3.14 shows how this works end-to-end.</p>

<p><em>Listing 3.14: Using the prompt template.</em></p>

<p>Now we can reuse our prompts by simply loading the JSON prompt template file and
calling the <code>completion()</code> function with the right parameters to be replaced.</p>

<p>To keep things simple, we used <code>text-davinci-003</code>. Since this is more expensive
than <code>gpt-3.5-turbo</code>, let‚Äôs also provide an alternative that templates chat
completions. Listing 3.15 shows how our lawyer large language model template
would look like for chat completions. We‚Äôll store this as <code>lawyer_chat.json</code>.</p>

<p><em>Listing 3.15: Lawyer prompt template for chat completion.</em></p>

<p>The JSON looks a lot like the one in listing 3.11, except instead of a <code>prompt</code>
string property we have a <code>messages</code> array property containing a list of <code>role</code>
and <code>content</code> pairs. This is very much in line with the differences between the
completion API and the chat completion API.</p>

<p><em>Listing 3.16: Consuming a chat completion prompt template.</em></p>

<p>Not very different from listing 3.13. We have the same <code>insert_params()</code>
function. We still take a template JSON in the constructor and store it as a
member, and we have a static <code>from_file()</code> method. The only difference is in the
<code>completion()</code> method: instead of inserting the parameters in the <code>prompt</code>
string, we now iterate over the <code>messages</code> and insert parameters in each content
item. This class is also available in <code>llm_utils</code>.</p>

<p>The equivalent call that puts it all together is very similar to listing 3.14:
see listing 3.17.</p>

<p><em>Listing 3.17: Using the lawyer chat completion prompt template.</em></p>

<p>We now have a way to store valuable prompts (including additional call
parameters like <code>temperature</code>) as JSON files, and only customize the moving
parts. This is in line with good software practices like the
‚Äúdon‚Äôt-repeat-yourself‚Äù principle.</p>

<p>In general, when integrating a large language model into a software solution,
you will have one or more tuned prompts you‚Äôll want to use. A lot of the prompt
content will be common across calls ‚Äì this is the <em>secret sauce</em> you‚Äôll spend
time tuning. Some parts will be different from API call to API call, based on
the current context. Those are parameters to the template.</p>

<p>In most cases though, you will end up with multiple useful prompt templates. How
can you find the right one to pick?</p>

<h2 id="prompt-selection">Prompt selection</h2>

<p>Selecting the right prompt for the job can seem complicated, but we have an easy
solution: we can rely on the large language model to identify which prompt to
pick! Figure 3.2 shows how this will work.</p>

<p><img src="images/03/fig2.png" alt="Figure 3.2"></p>

<p><em>Figure 3.2: Prompt selection.</em></p>

<p>The 3 steps of prompt selection are:</p>

<ol>
<li>We start with a user ask. We use a selection prompt template in which we put
the user ask to end up with a selection prompt. We send this to the large
language model.</li>
<li>We get back a selected prompt and input for that prompt. These are produced
by the model based on the user ask.</li>
<li>We then use the prompt template selected by the large language model and put
the selected input into it to come up with the final prompt which we‚Äôll send to
the model to accomplish the task.</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, let‚Äôs say we have 2 tuned prompts: a lawyer prompt and a writer
prompt. The lawyer prompt we saw in the previous section (listing 3.15), taking
an <code>action</code> and a <code>document</code> and acting as a lawyer. This is great for drafting
and NDA, but not as good for creative writing. Our writer prompt is captured in
listing 3.18, which we‚Äôll save as <code>writer_chat.json</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span>

</pre></div>

<p><em>Listing 3.18: Writer prompt template for chat completion.</em></p>

<p>For simplicity‚Äôs sake, we‚Äôre also using <code>action</code> and <code>document</code> parameters in
this case (and our examples aren‚Äôt highly-tuned prompts, but that doesn‚Äôt matter
‚Äì here we‚Äôre focusing on the prompt selection mechanism rather than the prompts
themselves).</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs say instead of an NDA draft, we want a haiku. Listing 3.19 uses the writer

<p><em>Listing 3.20: Prompt selection prompt template for chat completion.</em></p>

<p>We‚Äôre using a <code>temperature</code> of 0, since we want the large language model to do
its best at identifying the user ask and not get creative (at least not at this
stage). This prompt is tuned to ensure, as much as possible, the response we get
is in the format we want, so we can process it automatically.</p>

<p>We are also using a couple of example asks and responses in the prompt. This is
called <em>few-shot learning</em>, which we‚Äôll cover in depth in chapter 4. At a
high-level, we are providing examples, so the large language model understands
the pattern we want for our responses. In our case, we‚Äôre actually looking for a
JSON object with the properties <code>as</code> (can be <code>lawyer</code> or <code>writer</code>), <code>action</code>,
and <code>document</code>. We described the format in the first <code>system</code> message, but
showing a couple of examples helps.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs take this for a spin: we‚Äôll see what this prompt says about a couple of
asks, as shown in listing 3.21.</p>

<p><em>Listing 3.21: Using the prompt selection prompt template for chat completion.</em></p>

<p>Running this code should output something like listing 3.22.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>{&quot;as&quot;: &quot;lawyer&quot;, &quot;action&quot;: &quot;draft&quot;, &quot;document&quot;: &quot;an open-source license document.&quot;}
{&quot;as&quot;: &quot;writer&quot;, &quot;action&quot;: &quot;write&quot;, &quot;document&quot;: &quot;a funny skit.&quot;}
</pre></div>

<p><em>Listing 3.22: Selection prompt response.</em></p>

<p>In the first case, we get back, as expected, <em>lawyer</em>, with the <code>action</code> <em>draft</em>
and the <code>document</code> <em>an open-source license document</em>. In the second case,
<em>writer</em>, with <em>write</em> and <em>funny skit</em>.</p>

<p>We are leveraging the large language model to figure out what the user intent
is. In general, this mechanism of prompt selection works very well since
understanding user intent is a natural language processing task, a task at which
large language models excel.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs put everything together now, and write a small program that takes some
user input, identifies which prompt to use (using <code>selection_chat.json</code>), then
invoke the identified prompt. Listing 3.23 shows the end-to-end.</p>

</pre></div>

<p><em>Listing 3.23: Interactive ask with prompt selection.</em></p>

<p>We now have an interactive session where the user types in an <code>ask</code>. We quit if
this is <code>exit</code>, otherwise we invoke our selection prompt. For debugging
purposes, we print the content of this first response. Assuming the response is,
as requested, valid JSON with the properties we require, we use the
<code>json.loads()</code> function to parse the JSON string into an object.</p>

<p>We then load the prompt we‚Äôll use to accomplish the user ask. We use
<code>selection[&#39;as&#39;]</code> prepended to <code>&#39;_chat.json&#39;</code>, to load the appropriate template
prompt. For example, if our JSON object has <code>&quot;as&quot;: &quot;lawyer&quot;</code>, the string becomes
<code>&#39;lawyer_chat.json&#39;</code>.</p>

<p>We also pass in the two parameters, <code>action</code> and <code>document</code>, from the JSON
object. This is done for clarity, as we could‚Äôve used keyword arguments here and
simply pass <code>**selection</code>.</p>

<p>We then print the response we get back. You can run this code and play with it,
trying different asks. This implements the system we described in figure 2. This
concrete implementation is shown in figure 3.3.</p>

<p><img src="images/03/fig3.png" alt="Figure 3.3"></p>

<p><em>Figure 3.3: Prompt selection for lawyer and writer prompt templates.</em></p>

<ol>
<li>We replaced the generic ‚Äúuser input‚Äù with an actual ask, ‚ÄúI need a funny
skit‚Äù.</li>
<li>Using the selection prompt will give us back a JSON object containing the
template we should use (<code>writer</code> in this case) and the parameters we need to
provide to the template.</li>
</ol>

<p>Until now, we only saw simple examples ‚Äì sending some prompt and printing the reply. This is the first time when we stepped up our game and ran a 2-step process:</p>

<ol>
<li>We first identify user intent and select the best prompt for the task.</li>
<li>We use the selected prompt to accomplish the task.</li>
</ol>

<p>We just built a pipeline that includes a couple of prompts! This is also known
as <em>prompt chaining</em>.</p>

<h2 id="prompt-chaining">Prompt chaining</h2>

<p>For any but the simplest tasks, it‚Äôs unlikely we can accomplish them through a
single prompt. We need to facilitate a back and forth between the user and the
large language model.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: <em>Prompt chaining</em> refers to the process of generating a
sequence of prompts that build upon each other to achieve a specific task or
goal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Prompt chaining involves using the output of one prompt as the input to the next
prompt, gradually refining the input until we achieve the desired output.</p>

<p>The goal of prompt chaining is to improve the accuracy and relevance of the
model&#39;s output by providing more context and guidance for the model to work
with. We just saw an example of this in the previous section, where we first
identify user intent, which persona (lawyer or writer) is best suited to help
the user, then picked the follow-up prompt.</p>

<p>The term ‚Äúprompt chaining‚Äù is pretty broad: in some cases, you will see this
used when covering the simpler scenario of maintaining chat history and sending
it to the large language model on each call.</p>

<h3>Maintaining context</h3>

<p>We saw a simple command line chat in chapter 2, listing 2.8. Let‚Äôs revisit
command line chat here, focusing on the history part. First, we‚Äôll create an
interactive chat using our new <code>ChatTemplate</code>, but without maintaining any
history between subsequent calls. Listing 3.24 shows this initial
implementation.</p>

</pre></div>

<p><em>Listing 3.24: Command line chat without history.</em></p>

<p>Here we don‚Äôt load the template from a file, rather we create it from a
dictionary. We only set the <code>messages</code>, the first one being the system manage
telling the AI who to act like, and the second being the user prompt, which is a
parameter we replace at runtime with the input user is typing.</p>

<p>This works, and we can get the model to answer your questions, but we might
wrongly assume it ‚Äúsees‚Äù the same conversation as we do. For example, we can ask
‚ÄúHow to iterate over the files in a directory using the shell?‚Äù. This should
give us back a quite detailed reply on how to do this in a Unix-like shell,
including a small code sample:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To iterate over the files in a directory using the shell, you can use a combination of the <code>for</code> loop and the <code>ls</code> command. Here is an example command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">for</span><span class="w"> </span>file<span class="w"> </span><span class="k">in</span><span class="w"> </span>/path/to/directory/*<span class="p">;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">do</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="nb">echo</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">$file</span>
<span class="k">done</span>
</pre></div>

<p>This will loop through each file in the directory specified by
<code>/path/to/directory/</code>, and print the file name to the console using the <code>echo</code>
command. You can replace <code>echo</code> with any other command you wish to run on each
file.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But say we‚Äôre on a Windows PC, and would actually like to learn how to do this
in PowerShell. If our next prompt is ‚ÄúHow do I do this in PowerShell?‚Äù, the
response we get is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m happy to help. What exactly do you want to do in PowerShell? Whether it&#39;s
a specific task or a general question about the language, feel free to ask and
I&#39;ll do my best to assist you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously, the large language model doesn‚Äôt know what ‚Äúthis‚Äù refers to in this
context, since it doesn‚Äôt remember the first question we asked.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs update our code to maintain a history of the chat. Listing 3.25 shows
this.</p>

</pre></div>

<p><em>Listing 3.25: Command line chat with history.</em></p>

<p>In this updated sample, we keep a history of the chat in the <code>messages</code> list. We
append each user prompt as a new item, then we also append the response we get.
Now if we ask the same questions, ‚ÄúHow to iterate over the files in a directory
using the shell?‚Äù, then ‚ÄúHow do I do this in PowerShell?‚Äù, the second question
yields us this reply:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In PowerShell, you can also use a <code>foreach</code> loop to iterate over the files in
a directory. Here&#39;s an example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">foreach</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$file</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="nb">Get-ChildItem</span> <span class="n">-Path</span> <span class="s1">&#39;C:\path\to\directory&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c"># Do something with $file</span>
    <span class="nb">Write-Host</span> <span class="nv">$file</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>In this example, <code>Get-ChildItem</code> command lists all the files in
<code>C:\path\to\directory</code>, and then the <code>foreach</code> statement loops through the files
one by one, storing each file in the <code>$file</code> variable. You can replace
<code>Get-ChildItem</code> with any PowerShell cmdlet that generates a list of files (e.g.
<code>Get-Content</code>, <code>Select-String</code>, etc.).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The large language model now understands what ‚Äúthis‚Äù refers to, since on each
chat prompt we pass back the whole conversation.</p>

<p>In this example, <em>prompt chaining</em> refers to maintaining the context of the chat
across multiple prompts, so the large language model can use it when generating
a reply.</p>

<p>Figure 3.4 shows prompt chaining when using chat history.</p>

<p><img src="images/03/fig4.png" alt="Figure 3.4"></p>

<p><em>Figure 3.4: Prompt chaining when using chat history.</em></p>

<p>This is a simple loop consisting of:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use provides some input.</li>
<li>We combine this with the chat history to come up with a prompt which we send
to the large language model.</li>
<li>We get a response back. We update the history, so it contains the latest
prompt and response, then we go back to step 1.</li>
</ol>

<p>To recap, when we used prompt selection, we chained prompts by using the first
prompt to determine what the second prompt will be. In this example, we chained
prompts by maintaining a history and making it available to the large language
model on each call. The scenarios are quite different, but they are both
examples of prompt chaining.</p>

<h3>Implementing a workflow</h3>

<p>Let‚Äôs look at a more complex scenario that implements a short workflow, which
includes both maintaining context across prompts and prompt selection. We‚Äôll
implement a chat bot that handles coffee shop orders. Our workflow will have 3
steps: get the order, confirm the order, get contact information.</p>

<p>On step 1, we will get the order from the user. This can happen over multiple
chat interactions. We‚Äôll have to maintain a history of the chat and continue the
conversation until we have the full order. Then we move to step 2.</p>

<p>In step 2, we confirm the order with the user. If they would like to change
anything, we go back to step 1. Once confirmed, we go to step 3.</p>

<p>In step 3, we ask for a phone number.</p>

<p>Notice this example requires both chat history and a prompt selection mechanism.
Figure 3.5 shows the high-level workflow.</p>

<p><img src="images/03/fig5.png" alt="Figure 3.5"></p>

<p><em>Figure 3.5: 3-step workflow.</em></p>

<p>We will implement this with 2 prompts. The first prompt will handle the order
interaction and confirmation, while the second prompt will handle getting the
phone number.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs look at the prompts first. Listing 3.26 shows the prompt for steps 1 and
2, saved as <code>order.json</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">&quot;temperature&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">&quot;messages&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">&quot;role&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;system&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">&quot;content&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;You are taking orders for a coffee shop. The beverage items on the menu are: drip coffee, espresso, americano, tea (green or herbal). They come in small, medium, and large sizes. The food items are: croissant (plain or butter), muffin (blueberry or cheese). Identify what the customer wants to order and ask for clarifications when needed. You must get enough details for a coffee shop employee to be able to fulfil the order. For example, an order cannot be fulfilled without knowing the beverage size, or tea flavor, or type of croissant, or type of muffin. You must double check the order with the customer. As soon as the customer confirms the order, you will reply with the word ORDER followed by the order details then by the word DONE. For example: &#39;ORDER a small herbal tea DONE&#39;.&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">},</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">&quot;role&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;assistant&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">&quot;content&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;Hi! What can I get for you today?&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">}</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p><em>Listing 3.26: Order and confirmation prompt template.</em></p>

<p>Using this prompt, we would continue the chat until we see <code>ORDER</code> and <code>DONE</code> in
the response. Then we should be able to extract the actual order from between
these words.</p>

<p>Note the prompt asks the large language model to double check the order. Using
this prompt combined with our chat with history, the model should continue the
conversation until it has enough details for the order (step 1), confirm the
order with the customer (step 2), then, if the order is confirmed, send a
specially formatted reply which we can interpret to stop this chat and switch to
the next prompt for getting the phone number. The second prompt appears in
listing 3.27 (saved as <code>phone.json</code>).</p>

<p><em>Listing 3.28: Coffee ordering workflow.</em></p>

<p>We implement a <code>step()</code> function which takes as arguments a prompt template file
and a regular expression. We load the template, output the last message from the
template. In our two templates, these would be ‚ÄúHi! What can I get for you
today?‚Äù and ‚ÄúCan I please have your phone number?‚Äù</p>

<p>We then start the chat loop, waiting for input from the customer. We continue
the chat, adding both the customer input and the large language model response
to the chat history, until the response contains the word <code>DONE</code>.</p>

<p>Once we see <code>DONE</code>, we search for the provided regular expression and return the
matching string. This lets us extract the order, captured between <code>ORDER</code> and
<code>DONE</code> (<code>r&#39;ORDER(.*)DONE&#39;</code>) and the phone number, captured between <code>PHONE</code> and
<code>DONE</code> (<code>r&#39;PHONE(.*)DONE&#39;</code>).</p>

<p>We invoke this <code>step()</code> function for the two prompts and the corresponding
regular expressions. Finally, we print the extracted order and phone number.</p>

<p>A conversation might look like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi! What can I get for you today?</p>

<p>Customer: An americano please</p>

<p>Sure thing! What size would you like your americano? We have small, medium,
and large.</p>

<p>Customer: Medium</p>

<p>Great! Anything else for you today? We have drip coffee, espresso, tea (green
or herbal), croissants (plain or butter), and muffins (blueberry or cheese).</p>

<p>Customer: That&#39;s it</p>

<p>Alright, so just to confirm, you would like a medium americano. Is that
correct?</p>

<p>Customer: Wait, I&#39;d also like a butter croissant</p>

<p>Sure thing! So you would like a medium americano and a butter croissant. Is
that correct?</p>

<p>Customer: Yes</p>

<p>Can I please have your phone number?</p>

<p>Customer: 555-000-1234</p>

<p>a medium americano and a butter croissant</p>

<p>555-000-1234</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the example above, the model does as instructed in the prompt template and
confirms the order (step 2 of our workflow). If the customer changes their mind
and wants to add something to the order, the conversation continues. Once the
order is confirmed, we go to step 3 and start the phone number conversation.</p>

<p>The final <code>print()</code> statements prove the right information was extracted, which
we could pick up and pass on to some other subsystem.</p>

<p>Unlike our first prompt selection example, where we got the large language model
to output formatted JSON, in this case we used a couple of ‚Äúspecial‚Äù words to
allow us to post-process the response. Either approach works. In this case, JSON
output would‚Äôve made the prompts a bit longer and our code that figures out when
to stop a bit more complicated than what we‚Äôre doing now (checking for the
substring <code>DONE</code>). For more complex output, as we saw during prompt selection,
JSON is easier to parse.</p>

<p>This was a simple workflow demonstrating prompt chaining with 3 steps and 2
prompts. We relied both on chat history (for the conversation parts), and on
prompt selection ‚Äì our code figures out when to stop running the ordering chat
and switch to the phone chat. Of course, we can implement more complex workflows
involving more steps and more complex prompt selection.</p>

<h3>Implementation layers</h3>

<p>An interesting thing to note, and to keep in mind as you work with large
language models, is that implementation spans both code and natural language
(prompts).</p>

<p>In our simple workflow example, we combined steps 1 and 2 in a single prompt, so
our decision logic of whether to go from step 1 to step 2 and from step 2 to
step 3 or back to 1 was ‚Äúimplemented‚Äù mostly through natural language in the
<code>order.json</code> prompt (plus the code we use to determine when we are switching to
step 3, that is seeing the substring <code>DONE</code> in the response).</p>

<p>We can move more of the implementation in the prompt, for example have a single
prompt that instructs the model to get the phone number too once the order is
confirmed, then return both the order and the phone number in some specific
format we can pick up. One drawback of pushing more logic in the prompt is that
we end up with longer prompts where we need to explain more to the large
language model and rely on it to interpret more complex instructions the way we
expect.</p>

<p>Alternately, we can move more of the implementation in the code, for example
have a prompt that gets the order and a separate prompt for the confirmation.
For example, have the confirmation prompt instruct the model to respond with
<code>CONFIRMED</code> or <code>NOT CONFIRMED</code>, then we can in the code implement the decision
logic of whether to go back to step 1 (continue getting the order) or move to
step 3 (get the phone number). One drawback of pushing more logic in the code is
ending up having to maintain more lines of code and a more prompts.</p>

<p>On one extreme, we have just one huge prompt. On the other extreme, we have only
code - that‚Äôs what we were doing before large language models were a thing. In
practice, we need to find the sweet spot between these two extremes. Of course,
there is no one-size-fits-all to do this. What belongs in code and what belongs
in prompts depends on the scenario. If it is easy to get the expected responses
out of the large language model, we use prompts. When we need more deterministic
behavior, or run into token limits, or want to save costs, we use code.</p>

<p>In this chapter we taught the model, through our prompts, how to return output
formatted in a very specific way. You probably noticed many of the prompts also
included examples of how we expected the responses to look like. Even though the
models are pretrained, turns out they can still ‚Äúlearn‚Äù some things. The next
chapter digs into ways we can teach large language models.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<ul>
<li>Prompt tuning is the process of tweaking a prompt that elicits the responses
we expect from large language models. This yields a refined prompt.</li>
<li>A good prompt has proper syntax and includes who the model should act like,
additional context, who the audience is, how the output should look like, how
to generate the output, and examples.</li>
<li>Prompt templates allow us to reuse good prompts by parameterizing
instance-specific parts and keeping the rest of the prompt unchanged.</li>
<li>Prompt selection means deciding which prompt to pick out of several options to
best complete a task.</li>
<li>Prompt chaining is the process of connecting multiple prompts together, either
through prompts selection, by maintaining a history of previous prompts and
responses, or both.</li>
<li>Working with large language models, we have two layers of implementation: one
in code, one in natural language (in the prompts).</li>
<li>We can push logic from one layer to another, depending on the specific problem
we are trying to solve and tradeoffs we need to consider.</li>
