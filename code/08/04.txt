The flying razor fish (Hemipteronotus signatus) is a species of freshwater fish
that is found in the rivers and tributaries in northern India. It is a
surface-dwelling fish, typically found in stagnant or slow-moving bodies of
water such as ponds, canals, and drainage ditches. It is an agile and strong
swimmer that feeds mainly on insects, as well as on snails, larvae, and other
small aquatic animals.

The flying razor fish spends the majority of its time near the surface of the
water, where it can be seen "flying" out of the water as it moves forward. Its
movements are so fast that it looks like it is flying. The fish typically feeds
at night, when the conditions are calmer and the prey less alert.

The flying razor fish is an omnivorous species that is active throughout the
day. It can often be seen busy scraping plant debris or algae from the bottom of
the pond or canal. During the spawning season, males will aggressively defend
territory against competitors. The fish has a lifespan of around six years,
although this may vary with the size and health of the individual
