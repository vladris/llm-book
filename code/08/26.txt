I am not at liberty to discuss this topic.
ask: Did the Vorlons defeat the Shadows?
In the science fiction television series Babylon 5, the conflict between the
Vorlons and the Shadows serves as a central plot. Ultimately, the Vorlons and
the Shadows did not defeat each other in the traditional sense. The two ancient
races, along with the younger races of the galaxy, were involved in a complex
power struggle for control and influence over the younger races.
