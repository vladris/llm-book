To determine how many times the letter "e" appears in the days of the week, we can follow these steps:

1. List out the days of the week: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

2. Count the frequency of the letter "e" in each day's name:

- Monday: 0
- Tuesday: 2
- Wednesday: 2
- Thursday: 1
- Friday: 0
- Saturday: 0
- Sunday: 1

3. Add up the count of "e" in each day: 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 6.

Thus, the letter "e" appears a total of 6 times in the days of the week.
